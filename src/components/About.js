                    <h3>I'm a Web Developer based in the GTA</h3>
                    <p>I enjoy turning designs into interactive and reponsive web sites.
                        I love pushing the boundaries of my skills, and learning different ways of solving a problem.
                        When I'm not in front of a computer, I can be found either baking, painting, travelling, or solving puzzles. </p>
